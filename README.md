# Python-Project-16-Building-a-Spam-Filter-with-Naive-Bayes
We're going to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Our goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% â€” so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).
